### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Im a student in electronics and it, this means I can:
  - write software (c/c++)
  - program networks (c/c++)
  - program hardware (c/c++/VHDL/Structured text)
  - create electronic schematics (altium designer)
  - create PCBs (altium designer)
  - solder electronic devices
  - create websites (Fullstack)

This being a pretty wide variety does not mean I enjoy doing it all. Personally I prefere writing software and programming hardware. My interest in electronics is high but it is not my strong suit. These are the things that I enjoy and wish to focus on more.
